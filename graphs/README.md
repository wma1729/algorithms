# Graphs

A graph, **G = (V, E)**, is a data structure that consists of **V** vertices and **E** edges.
An edge connects two vertices and is represented by a pair of the two vertices it connects, (*v1*, *v2*).
A graph could be:
* **directed**, with a sense of direction, where an edge is an ordered pair (*v1*, *v2*),
* **undirected** where an edge is an unordered pair (*v1*, *v2*) and (*v2*, *v1*).
