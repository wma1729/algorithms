# Data Structures

## Heap
A heap is a binary tree that follows the following rules:
- **Order**
  - the key of every node is greater than or equal to the key of its children, called *maxheap* OR
  - the key of every node is smaller than or equal to the key of its children, called *minheap*.
- **Shape**
  - the tree is perfectly balanced: the leaf nodes are at most at the two lowest levels and those on the bottom level are as far left as possible.
